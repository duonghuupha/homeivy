                    <p>My dog is 10 this year. She has been going to this grooming salon every day for the past
                        five years. Thanks to the care and special shampoos used at SpaDog, she is now in very
                        good health again.</p>

                    <p>I bring my Westie “Dougie” to SpaDog for the past 4 years. Their groomers are fantastic,
                        always do an amazing job and are always so nice and cheerful. Would recommend them to

                    <p>I really feel comfortable leaving my Max at SpaDog. He always comes homes happy and
                        relaxed and the groomers there are warm, friendly and welcoming. They always do what you
                        ask.</p>

                    <p>We are in the area for a few months and my 2 furry boys needed grooming. SpaDog team was
                        very friendly and the boys liked it there. They did not have to spend a lot of time
                        there like so many places.</p>
